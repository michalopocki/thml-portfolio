<h1>The Best Movies According To Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>The musical score plays an even greater role in “The Godfather: Part II” than it did in the original film. Nostalgic, mournful, evoking lost eras, it stirs emotions we shouldn't really feel for this story, and wouldn't, if the score were more conventional for a crime movie.</p>
<h3>Seven</h3>
<p>It is almost always raining in the city. Somerset, the veteran detective, wears a hat and raincoat. Mills, the kid who has just been transferred into the district, walks bare-headed in the rain as if he'll be young forever.</p>
<h3>A.I. Artifical Inteligence </h3>
<p>Stanley Kubrick always referred to the story as "Pinocchio." It mirrored the tale of a puppet who dreams of becoming a real boy.</p>
